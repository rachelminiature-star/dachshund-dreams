        <p>
          We guarantee that you will be provided with a healthy Dachshund puppy, free of any serious congenital diseases,
          for up to <strong>1 year</strong> after the time of sale. In order to ensure this guarantee, the buyer must
          have the puppy examined by a licensed veterinarian within 48 hours of pickup or delivery.
        </p>
        <p className="font-medium text-foreground">This guarantee does NOT include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>Common health conditions that can afflict all dogs — demodex mange, coccidiosis, parvo, giardia, inguinal or umbilical hernias, hypoglycemia, ear mites, fleas, or ticks.</li>
          <li>Conditions considered normal for the Dachshund breed — cherry eye, entropion, skin allergies, elongated soft palate, stenotic nares (pinched nostrils), uneven bites, or "loose hips."</li>
          <li>Matters of size, weight, structure, coat quality, or temperament.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          If the buyer refuses the required examination or does not have it performed within the 48-hour time limit, the
          buyer assumes complete responsibility for the puppy's health, and this contract is considered void.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-display text-xl text-foreground">Replacement Policy</h3>
        <p>
          If the puppy does not pass the required examination, develops any genetic or hereditary disorder, or has
          undescended testicles within one year of purchase, it will be eligible for a replacement.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>The buyer must provide documentation from at least two licensed veterinarians including written diagnosis, test results, and any other information requested by the seller. The buyer remains financially responsible for all veterinary expenses.</li>
          <li>Upon replacement, the puppy must be returned with all registration documents to transfer full ownership back to the seller.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If a genetic condition causes the puppy to die within one year of purchase, it will be eligible for replacement.
          A necropsy must be performed and a formal report issued by a licensed veterinarian. Once the seller receives
          and reviews the report, a final decision will be made. The buyer is financially responsible for all veterinary
          expenses during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The replacement puppy will be taken from a future litter and will be of the same sex and value as the original
          puppy. <strong>Cash refunds, in part or full, will not be given under any circumstances.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The buyer must pay the balance and pick up the puppy within 10 days of the arranged pick-up date unless special
          arrangements have been made. If the buyer fails to pick up the puppy within this period, the puppy will be
          resold and the buyer's deposit will be forfeited.
